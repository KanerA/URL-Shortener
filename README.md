# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Final 1 - URL shortner ðŸ“Ž

## I created a URL shortener for the likes of which nobody wants to open your emails or texts.

If you feel like it's hard to be a scammer these days and everybody is so conscious about what links they enter, 
you can use my service.

This service allows you to take your malicious & harmful link to the Virus (you probably built yourself because you're awesome), and shorten it to a nice, neat and adorable looking link that people are going to think is a video of puppies running in tall grass (ech).

## how to use

put your URL in the input field and then press the button.
that's it , your done
copy the link that will appear on the screen and send away to all those who will become your next month paycheck ðŸ˜‰.

Other features are - Wait For It...

## already exists

If you already used our service with the same url, we will notify you, and provide the original shortened version of that URL.

## statistics page

you will be able to see every time a gullible blonde or a dullard goof will use your link.
you can do so by taking your link (i.e [http://localhost:3000/api/jfU7tLBg3](https://www.barneystinsonblog.com/))
and add the word "statistics" between the words api & that weird number at the end of the link (i.e [http://localhost:3000/api/statistics/jfU7tLBg3](http://barneysvideoresume.com/))

** click the links, trust me ðŸ™„
